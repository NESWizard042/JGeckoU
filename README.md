## Overview
`JGecko U` is a replacement for [`TCP Gecko.NET`](https://github.com/Chadderz121/tcp-gecko-dotnet) as a platform independent Wii U RAM debugger and cheat code manager for Wii U titles.

It is the most advanced Wii U game hack/cheat development tool which is used by almost all mod developers and end users across all Wii U titles.
